# launchmeet
## A hackathon project at Cracking the Code 2015

As part of the Cracking the Code conference in New York, Jan. 29-30, 2015, 
a team of journalists, editors, entrepreneurs, and coders created a semi-working 
prototype for an app that would allow people with ideas and people with 
skills to find one another and join up as LaunchMates. 

The app is responsive and looks best on a phone.
